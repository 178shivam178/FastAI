# FastAI
The classification is performed on cat-vs-dog data.I have use fastai library for classifiction,which is work on the top of pytorch library.
fastai have pretrained model resnet50 which is used if classification
In this code, I have been used "learn.unfreeze()" method to train the complete model otherwise you can use learn.freeze() for training some layers.
requerd hardware-CPU OR GPU 8GB RAM etc
